- Hashing
- Pattern Matching Algorithms

## Algorithms

### Recursion

```
def fib(n):
  if n == 0: #base case
    return 0
  elif n == 1 or n == 2: #base case
    return 1
  else:
    return fib(n-1) + fib (n-2)
```
reptitive calls leads to undesirable exponential runtime and memory usage. Recursive calls are stored on stack and there is limited allocated memory for a program.

## Iteration

There is no overwheming of call stack.

```
def fib(n):
  if n == 0:
    return 0
  elif n == 1 or n == 2:
    return 1
  else:
    prev2 = 0 # fib(n - 2)
    prev = 1 # fib(n - 1)
    res = 0 # fib(n)
    for i in range(1, n): #process iteratively
      res = prev + prev2
      prev2 = prev
      prev = res
    return res
```
