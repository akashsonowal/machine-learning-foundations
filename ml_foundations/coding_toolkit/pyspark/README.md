# Spark

Spark is usable in Java, Scala, Python and R.

Spark's performance is 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce. For streaming, Flink is better than Spark.

Spark can use Data Sources (RDD / Non-RDD) like: 
- HDFS
- Cassandra (NoSQL)
- HBase
- Hive
- local files.

Spark runs on 
- standalone cluster of machines (on EC2)
- cluster managed with Hadoop Yarn or Mesos or Kubernetes (k8s)
