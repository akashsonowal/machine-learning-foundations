## Supervised Learning

Optimizing machine learning models based on previously observed features and labels. Typically, the goal is to attach the most likely label to some provided features

- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Performance of Models

## Unsupervised Learning

An approach within machine learning that takes in unlabeled examples and produces patterns from the provided data. Typically, the goal is to discover something previously unknown about the unlabeled examples.

- K-Means
- SVD
