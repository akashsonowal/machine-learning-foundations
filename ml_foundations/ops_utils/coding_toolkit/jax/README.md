# JAX

JAX is a Python Library designed for high-performance numerical computing especially machine learning research.

* FLAX (Google Brain): A high level neural network library designed for flexibility.
* Haiku (Deep Mind): high level neural network library (similar to Keras).
* Elegy (Poets AI): inspired by Keras.
* Swarm JAX: swarm training framework for layer parallel LM on heterogeneous nodes.
* RLax (Deep Mind): Building blocks for RL agents.
* Coax (Microsoft): Solve OpenAI gym environment.
* Jgraph (Deep Mind): Lightweight library for deep neural networks.
* Jax, M.D. (Microsoft): for differentiable physics.
