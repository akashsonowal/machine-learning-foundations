# Problem Statement and Metrics

# LinkedIn Feed Ranking

Design a personalized LinkedIn feed to maximize long-term user engagement. One way to measure engagement is user frequency, i.e, measure the number of engagements per user, but itâ€™s very difficult in practice. Another way is to measure the click probability or Click Through Rate (CTR).

On the LinkedIn feed, there are five major activity types:
| Category | Examples |
| Connection | Member connector follows member/company, member joins group |
Informational	Member or company shares article/picture/message
Profile	Member updates profile, i.e., picture, job-change, etc.
Opinion	Member likes or comments on articles, pictures, job-changes, etc.
Site-Specific	Member endorses member, etc.
