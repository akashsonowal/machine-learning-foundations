ML Fundamentals

# Introduction

## Supervised Learning

Optimizing machine learning models based on previously observed features and labels. Typically, the goal is to attach the most likely label to some provided features

## Unsupervised Learning

An approach within machine learning that takes in unlabeled examples and produces patterns from the provided data. Typically, the goal is to discover something previously unknown about the unlabeled examples.

## Deep Learning

Optimizing neural networks, often with many hidden layers, to perform unsupervised or supervised learning.

## Recommendation Systems 

Systems with the goal of presenting an item to a user such that the user will most ikely purchase, view, or like the recommended item. Items can take many forms, suich as music, movies, or products. Also called recommender systems.

## Ranking

Optimizing machine learning models to rank candidates, such as music, articles, or products. Typically, the goal Is to order the candidates such that the candidates which are most likely to be interacted with (purchased, viewed, liked, etc.) are above other candidates that aren't as likely to be interacted with.

# Prerequisite

## Features

A set of quantities or properties describing an observation. They can be binary like "day” and "night"; categorical like "morning”, "afternoon’, and "evening”; continuous like 3.141; or ordinal ike "threatened", "endangered", "extinct’, where the categories can be ordered. 

## Labels

Usually paired with a set of features for use in supervised learning. Can be discrete or continuous.

## Examples

Pairs of features and labels.

## Dimensions
Here, the number of features associated with a particular example. §

| Vector @ |
Here, a feature vector, which is a list of features representing a particular example.

| Matrix @
An array of values, usually consisting of multiple rows and columns. §

| Matrix Transpose @)
An operator that flips a matrix over its diagonal.
| Polynomial @
Afunction with more than one variable/coefficient pair.
| perivative @
Indicates how much the output of a function will change with respect to a change in its input.
| Probability €
How likely something Is to occur. This can be independent, such as the roll of the dice, or conditional, such as drawing two cards
subsequently out of a deck without replacement.
| Probability Distribution @)
Afunction that takes in an outcome and outputs the probability of that particular outcome occurring.
| Gaussian Distribution @)
Avery common type of probability distribution which fits many real world observations; also called a normal distribution.
| uniform Distribution @)
A probability distribution In which each outcome s equally likely; for example, rolling a normal six-sided die.
