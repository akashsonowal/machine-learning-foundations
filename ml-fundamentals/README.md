ML Fundamentals

# Introduction

## Supervised Learning

Optimizing machine learning models based on previously observed features and labels. Typically, the goal is to attach the most likely label to some provided features

## Unsupervised Learning

An approach within machine learning that takes in unlabeled examples and produces patterns from the provided data. Typically, the goal is to discover something previously unknown about the unlabeled examples.

## Deep Learning

Optimizing neural networks, often with many hidden layers, to perform unsupervised or supervised learning.

## Recommendation Systems 

Systems with the goal of presenting an item to a user such that the user will most ikely purchase, view, or like the recommended item. Items can take many forms, suich as music, movies, or products. Also called recommender systems.

## Ranking

Optimizing machine learning models to rank candidates, such as music, articles, or products. Typically, the goal Is to order the candidates such that the candidates which are most likely to be interacted with (purchased, viewed, liked, etc.) are above other candidates that aren't as likely to be interacted with.
