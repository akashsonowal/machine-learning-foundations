- What is the difference between content-based and collaborative-based filtering?
Content-based filtering doesn't rely on other users' data to form predictions. Collaborative-based filtering doesn't require features of a particular item or user.

- What's the difference between a hard-margin and soft-margin SVM?
Soft-margin SVMs introduce a slack variable which allows some points to lie on the wrong side of the margin
- CNNs are variations of fully-connected neural networks which:
Reduce the number of required parameters through weight sharing, strides and pooling
- What are some situations which would be suited for batch inferences? (check all that apply):
