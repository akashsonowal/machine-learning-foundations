# Introduction

state -> action
x -> y

given a state what actions to take? This cannot be supervised becuase we don't know optimal y but we can learn through rewadr function

reward function to teach how to take good actions

control robots
factory optimization
financial trading
playing games

2. 

(S, a, R(S), S')

R(s) is the reward associted at state S.

We traverse till we reach the terminal state.

Return helps us take into account time also to make our algorithm impatinet.

$$ R = R_{1} + \gamma R
