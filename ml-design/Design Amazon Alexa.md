Alexa is Amazon's custom-built voice assistant.

We're designing Amazon Alexa, a voice assistant. The voice assistant will delegate tasks to pre-created "skills" (weather, Uber, Spotify, etc).

To accomplish this we'll need to design 5 components:

Keyword Spotter
Automatic Speech Recognizer
Natural Language Understanding Engine
Dialog Manager
Text-to-Speech Engine
We'll need to rely on systems which we won't touch on or design:

Amazon's Echo Dot, a device used to interface with customers which includes a speaker and an array of microphones.
AWS which is a cloud infrastructure to host our microservies.
