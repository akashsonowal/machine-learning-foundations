- TF-IDF is a technique which represents text as:
The relative importance of each word in a given document.
- What is the difference between content-based and collaborative-based filtering?
Content-based filtering doesn't rely on other users' data to form predictions. Collaborative-based filtering doesn't require features of a particular item or user.
